## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I used a CSS reset to fix any margins set by default by the browser. 

I used the scroll parameter of the overflow property to ensure the correct displaying of elements at smaller heights. 

### Continued development
